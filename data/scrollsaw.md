I picked up woodworking as hobby beginning with creating small projects using a scrollsaw.
Starting with a 1:20 scale car I learnt the process of creating scrollsaw patterns, cutting
the pieces, assembling them, and finishing the model with sanding and oil.

I soon became bolder and did some projects with more detailed cuts such as the anchor, life belt,
and decorative inside cuts on the sides of this toiletries crate.
