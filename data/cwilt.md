Cwilt, colloquial Welsh for *"quilt"*, is an online
quilting fabrics and haberdashery shop which is built on
[Spree](https://spreecommerce.com/) and hosted on the
[Heroku](http://heroku.com) cloud platform.

The shop's front end has been customised to the company's brand, and some
functionality has been added through [an extension](flexible_variants) I wrote
to allow for expressing products as cuts from a whole.
