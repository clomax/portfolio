<!-- A friend of mine was in the process of starting an aerial photography
business and found that there are almost no custom UAV builders that -->

I built this quadcopter for my aerial photography business which was to be
called *Sunbird Aerial*. I intended to make aerial imagery available to smaller
businesses with smaller marketing budgets; this was to be made possible by
eliminating as many overheads as possble.

The aim, specific to building the quadcopter, was to build and tune the
aircraft in order to produce video that was as smooth as possible before any
stabilisation was added in post production. The most important parts to
consider are:

* the propellers and how well they are balanced

* the motors and the consistency of their output RPM

* the flight controller and how its PID values (among others) are tuned

* the camera's gimbal and how it's attached to the body

* the camera's settings (ISO, framerate)
