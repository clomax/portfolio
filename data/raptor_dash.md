Raptor Dash is an infinite runner game featuring the
skeleton of a velociraptor that has come to life running
through a museum. The aim of the project is to work with an
illustrator to produce a complete game.

The first step I made is animating a dinosaur skeleton. I made
placeholder bones, rigged them to a 2D inverse kinematics script,
and used Unity's built in animator to create the run cycle below.

After that I made a simple prototype in which the dinosaur can dodge
oncoming obstacles by switching between three lanes. If the dinosaur runs
into in obstacle it will fall to pieces.

Once I had practiced a workflow for animating I started working on animating
the final velociraptor, which had more joints in its legs, neck, and tail. The
video below shows that I can manipulate IK targets, combined with Unity's
animation system, to create a more complex run cycle.

After further development we ended up with audio, camera shake, lives, slow motion
crashing, and an animated game over menu showing high scores.
