Raptor Dash is an infinite runner game featuring the skeletons of prehistoric
beasts that have come to life running through a museum. The aim of the project
is to work with an illustrator to produce a complete game.

The first step I made is animating a dinosaur skeleton. I made placeholder
bones, rigged them to a 2D inverse kinematics script, and used Unity's built in
animator to create the run cycle below.

After that I made a simple prototype in which the dinosaur can dodge oncoming obstacles by switching between three lanes. If the dinosaur runs into in obstacle it will fall to pieces.
