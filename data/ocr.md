This is what I did for my BSc AI & Robotics. The task was to produce a standard
feed-forward neural network that can learn to distinguish between handwritten
digits between 0 and 9 and recognise digits from images that it had never
previously seen. A sample from the [dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) can be seen below:

The result was a model that could read previously unseen digits with 95% accuracy.
