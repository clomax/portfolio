This is what I did for my BSc AI & Robotics. The task was to produce a standard
feed-forward neural network that can learn to distinguish between handwritten
digits 0 to 9 and recognise digits from images that it had never previously
seen. The result was a model that could read previously unseen digits with 95%
accuracy.

A sample from the [dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) can be
seen below:

Above is photo of a whiteboard I was using to check my understanding of the
steps involved in training a neural network.
