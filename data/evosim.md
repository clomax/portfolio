<!--
Evosim is an experimental model of an artificial genepool. The idea came to me
through a combination of finding similar projects that caught my attention
and reading what others say that they want to see: interactive artificial life.
This project, being a prototype, doesn't have any interactive elements, however
this is an aspect that I would like to explore in the future.

Evosim is a highly experimental, prototype 3D artificial life simulator in
which creatures know of nothing but eating and mating. They evolve through the
process of natural selection and, over time, become more able to move around,
find food and find mates.

Either that or they completely die out. Tough cheese, that's nature.

You only control the camera with the mouse.

####Serving suggestions

  * Turn it on, do something else, come back in ~30 minutes to see the results
        of evolution.

  * Watch evolution unfold in real time. Have you ever caught yourself staring
        at a fish tank for hours? It's kind of like that.

  * Use it as a screensaver.

####Note

If you are running this on a laptop or an older machine I highly recommend you
go into the settings file and bring the total energy parameter down; this puts
a soft limit on how many creatures can exist simultaneously. The default figure
is the right amount for running this on an i5 or equivalent.

<!--
The simulation starts with a number of randomly generated creatures who evolve
through the process of natural selection, thereby becoming more able swimmers
and making it easier for them to find food and find mates.
