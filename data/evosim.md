Evosim is an experimental model of an artificial genepool. The main idea is to
simulate co-evolution where creatures are competing for food and mates
simultaneously and directly.

The idea for this project came to me through a combination of finding similar
projects that caught my attention and reading what others say that they want to
see: interactive artificial life.

This project doesn't have any interactive elements currently, since it's a
prototype of the core elements of the simulation, however this is an aspect
that I intend to explore in the future.

The simulation starts with a number of randomly generated creatures who evolve
through the process of natural selection, thereby becoming more able swimmers
and making it easier for them to find food and find mates.

Every feature of a creature is determined by its genetic model: a container of
attributes that decide its size, colour, limb structure, and movement pattern.

I used [Unity]() for this prototype because it made it easy to start the
project and see results quickly. In the future I intend to expand on this
prototype with the possibility of using the Bullet physics engine.
